## Seneca Roadmap
Seneca tries to follow a quarterly release schedule with major changes gated behind subsequent releases.
This is to enforce continuity of development, and to ensure that semver is properly followed. These goals
may change at any time based on challenges encountered or contributions from the community. High level
goals for major versions are noted below.

### 4.0 - Late 2016
* Reworking of the plugin system.
* Transport specification versioned and updated.
* Transport refactored fully into seneca-transport.
* New base Transport layer for preview.
* Full transport plug-ability supported.

### 5.0 - Early 2017
* Performance optimizations.

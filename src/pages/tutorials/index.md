# Tutorials
Seneca tutorials offer a deep dive into a particular concept or feature. We also have a number
of sample projects, small and large that demonstrate how to use Seneca in a number of different
ways and with different complimentary technologies.

## Guides

- [Logging with Seneca][]
- [How to write a plugin][]
- [Understanding data entities][]
- [Understanding query syntax][]
- [Understanding prior actions][]
- [Seneca with promises][]

## Sample projects
Sample projects are awesome. At Seneca, we have a good chunk of them available to study and
extend. Seneca examples contains multiple small, singularly focused sample projects. NodeZoo
is an example of a larger-scale project which is closer to a production ready system.

### Seneca examples
For convenience, we have a number of sample apps in a single repository. This repository
covers single concepts as well as popular plugins. See the repo at [Seneca examples][Sample02].

### NodeZoo
NodeZoo is a search engine for Node.js modules. The complete system is an example of a real-
world service built using Node.js microservices. Each microservice is published in its
own GitHub repository. The code base is intended to be used as a larger-scale example and as a
starting point for your own projects. See the system at [NodeZoo][Sample02].

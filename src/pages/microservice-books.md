Seneca supports all variants of the microservice architecture. The principle of transport independence means that everything from [classic HTTP REST](https://github.com/senecajs/seneca-transport) to [RabbitMQ work queues](https://github.com/senecajs/seneca-rabbitmq-transport) to [Redis publish/subscribe](https://github.com/rjrodger/seneca-redis-transport) works just fine. Thus, the ideas in the books listed here can be applied using Seneca without restriction. They all contain useful insights, and more importantly, real-world lessons.


# The Tao of Microservices

<img src="images/tms-cover-small.png" height="220" alt="Tao of Microservices" align="left" style="margin-right:20px">

The Tao of Microservices teaches you the path to understanding how to
apply microservices architecture with your own real-world
projects. This high-level book offers you a conceptual view of
microservice architectures, along with core concepts and their
application. You'll also find a detailed case study for the
nodezoo.com system, including all source code and documentation. By
the end of the book, you'll have explored in depth the key ideas of
the microservice architecture and will be able to design, analyze and
implement systems based on this architecture.

# Building Microservices

Distributed systems have become more fine-grained in the past 10
years, shifting from code-heavy monolithic applications to smaller,
self-contained microservices. But developing these systems brings its
own set of headaches. With lots of examples and practical advice, this
book takes a holistic view of the topics that system architects and
administrators must consider when building, managing, and evolving
microservice architectures.

We've spent over a decade now becoming more and more agile and
adaptable in our ways of working. Unfortunately our software is now
struggling to keep up with the pace of innovation that is increasingly
being demanded by modern businesses. It's time to sort that out. It's
time for Antifragile Software with Microservices.

# Microservices: Flexible Software Architectures

<img src="images/microservices-flexible.jpg" height="220" alt="Microservices: Flexible Software Architectures" align="left" style="margin-right:20px">

A Microservice-based architecture divides software systems into many
small services which can be deployed independently. Every team works
on its own Microservices and is thus decoupled from other teams. This
allows to easily scale agile processes. The modularization into
Microservices protects the system against architecture
decay. Consequently, systems based on Microservices stay maintainable
in the long term. In addition, legacy systems can be migrated to
Microservices without having to change the legacy code. Moreover,
Continuous Delivery is easier to implement in Microservice-based
systems.

Microservices in .NET shows you how to build and deploy secure and
operations-friendly microservices using Nancy. The book takes you
through an introduction to the microservices architectural
style. Next, you'll learn important practical aspects of developing
microservices from simple core concepts to more
sophisticated. Throughout the book, you'll see many code examples
implementing it with lightweight .NET technologies - most prominently
Nancy. By the end, you'll be able to quickly and easily build reliable
and operations-friendly microservices using Nancy, OWIN and other open
technologies.

# Microservices in GO

GO is a great language for building microservices. However there are a
lot of challenges to navigate. How do you do caching, manage
databases. Monitor and analyze performance. Integrate with Docker. Do
continous deployments. Run on private or public clouds.

# SOA Patterns

<img src="images/soa-patterns.png" height="220" alt="SOA Patterns" align="left" style="margin-right:20px">

SOA Patterns provides architectural guidance through patterns and anti-patterns. It shows you how to build real SOA services that feature flexibility, availability, and scalability. Through an extensive set of patterns, this book identifies the major SOA pressure points and provides reusable techniques to address them. Each pattern pairs the classic problem/solution format with a unique technology map, showing where specific solutions fit into the general pattern.

  <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6 txt-left">
    <p>Seneca is a microservices toolkit for Node.js. It provides plugins that look after the foundations of your app. This leaves you free to focus on the real, business code. No need to worry about which database to use, how to structure your components, or how to manage dependencies. Just start coding.</p>

    <p>You write everything as a command. Your commands get called whenever they match a set of properties. Your calling code doesn't know, or care, which command gets the work done. One JavaScript object goes in, and another comes out, asynchronously.</p>
